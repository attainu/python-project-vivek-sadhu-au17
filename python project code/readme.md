BATCH – SABRAHMANYAN

 









 
INTRODUCTION:-
The aim of this project is to build a python program that runs as a Command-line tool. Basically, as a lazy programmer, my desktop Is full of files as shown below. Due to a large number of files, it is A daunting task to sit and organize each file. To make that task Easy, we need a Python script that comes in handy and returns a Folder where all the files are organized in a well-manner within Seconds. It should organize by size, last used or even extensions. So below is a python program to organize or simplify everything in appropriate folder in the single go and remove empty directories.

What do it do?
❖ Organize by extension 
❖ Organize by size
 ❖ Organize by Date and time


How it appears?
❖ Whenever the user selects the option, the files will be organized based on the option selected by the user. 
❖ Below is the given scenario for which how they wanted to organize like.
 

ORGANIZE BY EXTENSION:- 
❖ By using this option user can organize their files by their file extension in a given folder, folder will be created according to file extension and finally all files will be moved to a created folder.

ORGANIZE BY SIZE:- 
❖ By using this option user can organize their files by their file size, according to file sizes random folders will be created and respective files will be moved to them.
ORGANIZE BY LAST USED/ACCESSED DATE:- 
❖By using this option user can organize their files by last used date. Random folders will be created according to files last used date and files will be moved to them.
NOTE:-  ❖If user not provide any think or user provide wrong path than program will tell to provide valid thing.
Before file execution, files look like:-


 

After file execution, files look like:-

 

At a glance:-

 ❖ I had used Shuttle/ Os modules for the file arrangement, Date and time to know when the files were created and many more built-in functions.
 ❖ I have a directory path where lots of files of different types are present (like above) and my program segregate each file type into their respective folders. 
❖ As a future scope of this project, we can design the ui for the program so that a normal user can easily interact with it. We can add more features like deleting the junk files after a certain period of time
